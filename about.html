    <h2 style="padding-top: 3% ;">    Who We Are    </h2>
    <p>Our DNA is made of ex-startup founders and the top talent in Product, UX/UI, Software development and Machine & Deep Learning. We came together from various backgrounds with one vision: to bring a lean, user-centric approach to product innovation and software development by completely understanding the business needs before building anything.
        Working With Top Talent Always Pays Off
        We have a rigorous screening process to identify the best talent, from inception, UXUI design, and development. We are always on the lookout for great problem solvers with passion and drive, these are the types of people we want to work with and learn from ourselves.
        </p>

<p>    Of the hundreds of applicants we see each month usually fewer than 1% join our ranks. This means our small, focused teams are able to deliver extraordinary results. As we are all based at our Harare HQ, communication between us is clear and concise – without barriers or interference.
